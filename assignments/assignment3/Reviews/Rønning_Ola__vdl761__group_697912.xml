    <question1>
      <title>Description of implementation and tests</title>
      <q1a>
        <text>
          Does the solution contain a clear description of the approach
          used to achieve before-or-after atomicity?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1a>
      <q1b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on any aspects that you found unclear in the
          description of the approach to achieve before-or-after atomicity
        </text>
        <answer>+1 for going with the high-granularity solution.</answer>
      </q1b>
      <q1c>
        <text>
          Does the code include implementations of Tests 1 and 2 of the
          assignment description as well as of at least another two test
          cases?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1c>
      <q1d-i>
        <text>
          Is it tested that the final state resulting from concurrent
          execution
          is correct in that it respects invariants designed in the test?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1d-i>
      <q1d-ii>
        <text>
          Is it tested that intermediate reads of the state during concurrent
          execution respect invariants designed in the test, so that it is
          arguable that these intermediate states could be found in an
          equivalent serial schedule?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1d-ii>
      <q1e>
        <text>
          Provide comments on why you found that any portions of the test
          descriptions were unclear according to the criteria, and suggestions for
          improvement
        </text>
        <answer>Since you cannot control how the scheduler choses to assign threads time slices, I see no guarantee that the threads are running at the same time in the 'testSerilizability()' test. One possible solution is to crate a test where threads can run continuously until a certain point. Not that it's particularly easy.</answer>

    <question2>
      <title>Correctness argument for locking protocol</title>
      <q2a>
        <text>
          Is the variant of 2PL to which equivalence is being established in
          the correctness argument clearly identified (e.g., conservative, strict,
          conservative strict)?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q2a>
      <q2b>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argumentation of why the steps in the locking
          protocol designed correspond to steps taken in the chosen variant
          of 2PL?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q2b>
      <q2c>
        <text>
          Is there an argument for the need to take into account predicate
          reads, with appropriate justification?
        </text>
        <answer>[YES/NO]</answer>
      </q2c>
      <q2d>
        <text>
          Provide comments on why you found any aspects of the correctness
          argument provided to be lacking, incorrect, or in need of improvement.
        </text>
        <answer>Arguments seems to cover all we can think of, but looking at the code I don't think the locking mechanism work. First little detail, is that the defined writeLock is in fact a readlock. Assuming that you did mean to write "readWriteLock.writeLock()" at line 29. One problem arising multiple places is the premature release of locks. Take addCopies as an example. You use a readlock to check the bookmap contains the appropriate book, but then release the lock before applying the changes. If another operation decides to remove some books, you are in trouble since the correct error is not returned. One possibility is to extend the read lock and upgrade it to a write lock at the appropriate time. But this is deadlock prone as per the textbook. Some kind of write lock is needed all through the operation.</answer>

    <question3>
      <title>Deadlocks</title>
      <q3a>
        <text>
          Does the solution contain a correct argument for why deadlocks can
          occur in the locking protocol or why deadlocks cannot occur?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q3a>
      <q3b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the argument provided with respect to
          deadlocks could be improved
        </text>
        <answer>I can see no problem in the arguments given.</answer>

    <question4>
      <title>Reflections on scalability</title>
      <q4a>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argument about the scalability limits of the
          concurrent implementation provided?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q4a>
      <q4b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the reflections on scalability could be
          improved
        </text>
        <answer>I think you avoid most scalability problems because the locking protocol does not ensure before-or-after atomicity. As discussed in the answer to question 2, you have to hold write locks for longer. This is a big source of overhead, and write operations suddenly become expensive.</answer>
      </q4b>

    <question5>
      <title>Argumentation on decisions made for performance</title>
      <q5a>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argument in the solution about the trade-off between
          locking overhead and concurrency?
        </text>
        <answer>[YES/NO]</answer>
      </q5a>
      <q5b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the argument about performance trade-offs in
          the locking protocol could be improved
