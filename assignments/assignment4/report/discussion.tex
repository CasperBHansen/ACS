\section{Discussion on the Performance Measurements}

\subsection{Setup}
The implementation of the tests is a pretty direct implementation of the
specifications of the test. The interesting part is how we ensure the test
show anything meaningful. In particular, we generate one big set of books and
only include a subset of these in the bookstore from the beginning. As a
design choice, we have abstracted out generation of books to the
{\tt BookSetGenerator} which we only make a single instance of passed by
reference to the workers. We feel this should in fact be singleton. This has
not been done for the {\tt WorkloadConfiguration} even though we feel the same
applies. Note also that we have a remaining error which causes certain ISBN
numbers to be duplicated. We will discuss the potential effects on the test
results separately.
