\subsection{Differences between non-volatile and stable storage}
Casper: The main difference of these types of storage is that stable storage relies on
book keeping to restore its data in the event of a system crash, while data in
non-volatile storage aren't affected by crashes.

Hans: non-volatile as well as stable storage retains stored data in the event of a
system shutdown or crash. The difference is that stable storage ensures
atomicity of operations, and thus system crashes may ruin the state of
non-volatile storage while stable storage is still in consistent state.
